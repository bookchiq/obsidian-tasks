# Introduction

> [!Danger]
> This is an experimental conversion of the Tasks user docs to Obsidian Publish, tracked in [#1706](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks/issues/1706).
>
> For now, please visit the [original documentation site](https://obsidian-tasks-group.github.io/obsidian-tasks/) instead.
>
> Every page here has a 'View this page on the old documentation site' section at the bottom, making it easy to compare the old and new sites side-by-side, and report and problems.
>
> For testing purposes, this site is published at [publish.obsidian.md/tasks](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/queries/sorting).
>
> You can read more about progress on this conversion, including known problems and remaining steps, at the [Migration to Publish](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/migration) page.

## Task management for the [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) knowledge base

Track tasks across your entire vault.
Query them and mark them as done wherever you want.
Supports due dates, recurring tasks (repetition), done dates, sub-set of checklist items, and filtering.

You can toggle the task status in any view or query and it will update the source file.
