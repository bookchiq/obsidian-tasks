# Status Collections

## Background

> [!success] Released
Custom statuses were introduced in Tasks 1.23.0.

You can control the behaviour of your tasks (such as what happens when you click on a checkbox), using Tasks' [[getting-started/statuses|Statuses]] feature.

The theme and snippet authors generally refer to this as 'custom checkboxes'.

Tasks only knows how to display two core statuses, `[space]` and `[x]`.

So before setting up custom statuses, you need to decide which CSS Snippet or Theme to adopt. This section will help with that.

## The Options

### Your current Theme or CSS Snippet

If you are already happy with a Theme or CSS Snippet that supports custom checkboxes, you can stop reading this section, and move on to configuring Tasks to use it: see [[how-to/set-up-custom-statuses|How to set up your custom statuses]].

### Selecting a Theme or CSS Snippet

Tasks provides easy one-click set up of all the Themes and CSS Snippets in the 'Table of Contents' below.

### Our recommendation: SlRvb’s Alternate Checkboxes

If you are unsure which to use, we recommend using a CSS Snippet rather than a Theme:

- Themes are very opinionated about lots of aspects of presenting your markdown.
- CSS Snippets can generally be used with a wide variety of Themes, so they keep your options a lot more open.

The very widely used [[reference/status-collections/slrvb-alternate-checkboxes-snippet|SlRvb’s Alternate Checkboxes]] snippet is excellent, and we recommend starting with that.

However, you can also browse through the pages in this section, to see the other options that Tasks is aware of.

## Coming soon

We plan to add one-click support for these themes in a future release:

- [LYT Mode](https://publish.obsidian.md/hub/02+-+Community+Expansions/02.05+All+Community+Expansions/Themes/LYT+Mode)

## Supported CSS Snippets and Themes
